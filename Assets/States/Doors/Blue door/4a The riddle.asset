  storyText: "A young man is arrested while on vacation for a minor infraction. He
    is put in a cell with a dirt floor and only one window. Although the window has
    no bars, it is too high for him to reach. The only thing in the cell is a shovel.
    He knows he won\u2019t get any food or water. He only has two days to escape
    or he\u2019ll die. How will he escape from the cell?\r\n1. Dig a tunnel to the
    outside\r\n2. Use the shovel to create a pile of dirt under the window "
